# Mapping_Earthquakes
Bootcamp Module 14

### Overview
The reason for this project eas to create a dynamic map for researching Eartquake data around the globe.

### results
With our map, we can find all the earthquakes around the world from the las 7 days. Using leaflet as a tool for creating a map nad javascript with GeoJSON, we can display all the information of earthquakes, major earthquakes and plate tectonics. Being a dynamic map, we have 3 different veiws, Street maps, satellite maps, and Night Navigations Map. We can toggle between these views, depending on the desired results. Also we can turn on and off the 3 types of data;
- All Earthquakes
- Major Earthqueakes
- Plate tectocnis
This wat we can visualize and analyze depending on the information the user is looking for.

### Summary
Using our map, we can see that most earthquakes tend to happen around the plate's borders. We can see a lot of movement through LatAm and Asia.
